Users in search of Add-On's, specifically Dolby Atmos™ with full functionality and Graphic User Interface, can find multiple Dolby Atmos™ ports from the premium device systems currently available like Axon™ 7 Pro and LeTv™ LeMax 2 at our app porter specialist's dedicated @XDA thread at the following address:


http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/soundmod-axon-7-dolby-atmos-t3412342


ahrion @XDA Developers is a top-level ARISE Sound Systems™ member and is OP of the Dolby Atmos™ Ports Collective thread linked above. The Dolby Atmos™ zips he's made available are the perfect solution to achieving a seamless Dolby Atmos GUI installation with any ARISE™ sound system. No file in the system will be overwritten and the audio_effects set will remain intact and fully functional via the respectful patching of these files during the installation.


No compromises and no difference whatsoever between an Add-On installation and an ARISE™ sound system with Dolby Atmos™ built-in, except for choices. The Add-On method simply opens the door to numerous build options and experimentation, from the lone processing of ViPER4Android, to the latest experimental Dolby Atmos™ port, possibly multiple simultaneous Dolby Atmos™ installations as his thread evolves, and everything in between. His thread also provides a dedicated resource for Dolby Atmos™ information and support, definitely the better option to be heard and guided by @XDA's finest regarding everything Dolby Atmos™.
