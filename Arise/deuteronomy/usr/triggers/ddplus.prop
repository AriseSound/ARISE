The ddplus.prop, when placed or renamed as /system/ddplus_YES.prop, will instruct the sound system installation script to install the Dolby™ Digital Plus add-on from @thereassaad @XDA Developers with the standard sound system.


If desiring only the standard sound system installation , simply ensure this file does not exist as /system/ddplus_YES.prop before installing the sound system zip.
