deep_buffer is a commonly used audio output for streaming media on current devices. However, its inclusion in /system/etc/audio_policy.conf and similar files can prevent ViPER4Android processing in some cases.

*

A script to remove any deep_buffer entries from these files during the sound system installation can be activated by copying this file and/or renaming to deep_buffer_YES.prop to result with:

  /system/usr/triggers/deep_buffer_YES.prop.

*

Only recommended if experiencing no ViPER4Android processing during streaming media playback.
